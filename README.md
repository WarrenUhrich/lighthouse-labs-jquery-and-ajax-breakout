# Lighthouse Labs | jQuery + Ajax Breakout

* [X] Discuss and demonstrate:
    * jQuery: a JavaScript library -> DOM manipulation, a nicer syntax for general front-end JavaScript, cross-browser/backwards compatibility
    * Ajax: a feature in JavaScript that allows us to (without reloading the current page or loading a new page) request information from a web address
